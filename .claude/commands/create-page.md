# Create a page

Argument: `[page-name]`

## Implement the plan

Implement a plan for creating a page, by reading the plan and following it.

Create new page components, data files, and TypeScript files as necessary in the `src/` directory.

Update React routing and component imports as needed to include the new page in the application build.

## Consult the crawl for details

The site crawl contains the source text, images, styling, etc. Rely on the crawl for details.

The plan should provide pointers to pages, sections and locations in the crawl from which site details can be obtained.
If it doesn't, search the crawl to find the best possible source data.

## Check the page URL

Verify that the page URL matches the page URL in the crawl.

If necessary, move the Markdown file to the correct location within the `src` tree to match the URL.
