# Create a page

Argument: `[page-name]`

## Implement the plan

Implement a plan for creating a page, by reading the plan and following it.

Create new page components, data files, HTML files and Markdown files as necessary in the `src/` directory.

Ensure that `.eleventy.js` is updated as needed to include the new page or assets in the site build.

## Check the page URL

Verify that the page URL matches the page URL in the crawl.

If necessary, move the Markdown file to the correct location within the `src` tree to match the URL.
