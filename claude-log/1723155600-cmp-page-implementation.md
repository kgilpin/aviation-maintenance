# CMP Page Implementation - 2025-08-09

## Task Completed
Successfully created a CMP (Civilian Marksmanship Program) page based on the crawl content from cmp.html.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `src/data/cmp.json` - CMP page content data
- `src/hooks/useCMPData.ts` - Custom hook for CMP data access
- `src/pages/CMP.tsx` - CMP page component
- `claude-log/1723155600-cmp-page-implementation.md` - This log file

### Modified Files:
- `src/data/types.ts` - Added CMPData interface
- `src/App.tsx` - Added CMP route `/cmp`

## Implementation Details

1. **Content Analysis**: Read cmp.html from crawl which contained a simple page with title "Civilian Marksmanship Program" and a certificate image (cmp.png)

2. **Data Structure**: Created CMPData interface with:
   - Title
   - Certificate image and alt text
   - Description
   - SEO metadata

3. **Component Architecture**: 
   - Uses MainLayout for consistent site structure
   - Implements React Helmet for SEO
   - Direct import of cmp.png image asset
   - Styled with Tailwind CSS matching original site aesthetics

4. **Original Site Fidelity**: 
   - Preserved the centered layout
   - Used border styling similar to original (5px solid #555)
   - Maintained the same title styling with Verdana font
   - Added appropriate alt text for accessibility

5. **Route Integration**: Added `/cmp` route to App.tsx routing configuration

## Build Test Results
- TypeScript compilation successful for CMP-specific code
- Minor unrelated TypeScript warnings in other components (unused variables)
- All CMP implementation files pass type checking

## Status
✅ CMP page implementation complete and ready for use
✅ Follows established project architecture patterns
✅ Maintains visual fidelity to original site
✅ Properly integrated into React routing system

The page should be accessible at http://localhost:8080/cmp once the development server is running.
