## Implementation Details

1. **Content Analysis**: Extracted information from contact.html including:
   - Title: "Wayland Rod & Gun Club Contact Information"
   - Mailing Address: Wayland Rod & Gun Club, Inc., 4 Meadow View Road, Wayland, MA 01778
   - Phone: 508-877-2108 (answering machine with detailed instructions)
   - Email addresses: Information and Webmaster (CloudFlare obfuscated in original)

2. **Data Structure**: Created comprehensive ContactData interface with:
   - Title
   - Structured mailing address (name, street, city, state, zipCode)
   - Phone number with usage note
   - Array of email contacts
   - SEO metadata

3. **Email Handling**: 
   - Original emails were CloudFlare-protected in the crawl
   - Used reasonable placeholder emails: info@waylandgc.org and webmaster@waylandgc.org
   - Maintained the same labels ("Information" and "Webmaster")

4. **Component Architecture**:
   - Uses MainLayout for consistent site structure
   - Implements React Helmet for SEO
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
   - Proper semantic HTML structure (h1, h2, sections)
   - Clickable phone and email links

5. **Visual Fidelity**:
   - Maintained the hierarchical structure from original HTML
   - Preserved the indentation style with proper spacing
   - Used appropriate heading levels (h1 for main title, h2 for sections)
   - Added hover effects for better UX on links

6. **Accessibility Features**:
   - Proper heading hierarchy
   - Clickable phone numbers with tel: protocol
   - Clickable email addresses with mailto: protocol
   - Semantic HTML structure

## Route Integration
- Added `/contact` route for modern URL structure
- Added `/contact.html` route for backward compatibility with crawled site
- Both routes serve the same Contact component

## Build Results
