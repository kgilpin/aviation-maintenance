## Task Completed
Successfully created a Previous Events page based on the PreviousEvents.html file from the crawl, including the historical Santa Ride 2010 event.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `src/data/previous-events.json` - Previous events data with Santa Ride 2010 information
- `src/hooks/usePreviousEventsData.ts` - Custom hook for previous events data access  
- `src/pages/PreviousEvents.tsx` - Previous events page component with event display
- `claude-log/1723158800-previous-events-page-implementation.md` - This log file

### Modified Files:
- `src/data/types.ts` - Added PreviousEvent and PreviousEventsData interfaces
- `src/App.tsx` - Added previous events routes `/previous-events` and `/PreviousEvents.html`
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` - Added PreviousEvents.html route mapping

## Implementation Details

1. **Content Analysis**: Analyzed minimal PreviousEvents.html file which contained:
   - Single image link to Santa Ride 2010 (138x85px)
   - Link to "SantaRide2010.html" (not found in crawl)
   - Reference to photo gallery with alt text "Click Image for 2010 Santa Ride Pictures"
   - Broken/unavailable linked content (404 errors)

2. **Data Structure**: Created comprehensive interfaces with:
   - **PreviousEvent**: Individual event with metadata, images, links, and status
   - **PreviousEventsData**: Complete page structure with events array and SEO
   - **Status System**: 'available', 'unavailable', 'archived' for content management

3. **Historical Event Preservation**:
   - **Santa Ride 2010**: Documented as December 2010 event
   - **Original Image Dimensions**: Preserved 138x85px sizing from crawl
   - **Unavailable Status**: Clearly marked as currently unavailable
   - **Original Link Reference**: Documented original SantaRide2010.html link

4. **Component Architecture**:
   - Uses MainLayout for consistent site structure
   - Implements React Helmet for SEO
   - Responsive design with flex layout for image/content
   - Status-aware rendering with visual overlays
   - Extensible structure for future events

5. **Visual Design**:
   - Event cards with image and details side-by-side
   - "Currently Unavailable" overlay on broken content
   - Border styling matching original (gray borders)
   - External link indicators for better UX
   - Informational notice about content status

6. **User Experience Features**:
   - Clear status indicators for unavailable content  
   - Graceful handling of broken/missing links
   - Future events notice encouraging current event participation
   - Responsive layout works on all device sizes
   - Proper accessibility with alt text and semantic HTML

## Route Integration
- Added `/previous-events` route for modern URL structure
- Added `/PreviousEvents.html` route for exact backward compatibility with crawl
- Updated Sidebar component to properly map PreviousEvents.html to React route
- Both routes serve the same PreviousEvents component

## Build Results
✅ TypeScript compilation successful after type assertion fix
✅ All previous events code passes type checking
✅ Proper bundle splitting with previous-events-B5-WHUBv.js (0.89 kB)
✅ CSS bundle includes event styling (16.54 kB total)
✅ No build errors or warnings

## Content Status Management

### Santa Ride 2010
- **Status**: Unavailable (original links return 404)
- **Preserved Information**: Title, date, image dimensions, alt text
- **Visual Treatment**: Overlay indicating unavailable status
- **Documentation**: Original link path preserved for reference

### Extensibility
- **Framework**: Ready to accommodate future events
- **Status System**: Supports available, unavailable, and archived content
- **Data Structure**: Flexible schema for events with optional images/links
- **Component Design**: Scalable event card layout

## Status
✅ Previous Events page implementation complete and ready for use
✅ Faithfully preserves historical Santa Ride 2010 event information
✅ Gracefully handles unavailable/broken content from original crawl
✅ Follows established project architecture patterns
✅ Properly integrated into React routing system
✅ Accessible at both `/previous-events` and `/PreviousEvents.html`

The implementation provides a professional archive page that acknowledges the club's event history while clearly communicating content availability status. The extensible structure allows for easy addition of future events when content becomes available.
