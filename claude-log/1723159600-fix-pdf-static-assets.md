# Fix PDF Static Assets - 2025-08-09

## Issue Identified
PDF files linked in navigation (`/pdf/RangeRules-20220414.pdf` and `/pdf/ArcheryRangeRules-20230221.pdf`) were not accessible at http://localhost:8080/pdf/ URLs.

## Root Cause
In Vite applications, static assets like PDFs need to be placed in the `public` directory to be served directly at the root path. The PDFs existed in the crawl but weren't copied to the correct location for serving.

## Solution Implemented

### Files Moved:
- **From**: `crawl/waylandgc.org/pdf/RangeRules-20220414.pdf`
- **To**: `public/pdf/RangeRules-20220414.pdf`

- **From**: `crawl/waylandgc.org/pdf/ArcheryRangeRules-20230221.pdf` 
- **To**: `public/pdf/ArcheryRangeRules-20230221.pdf`

### Actions Taken:
1. Created `public/pdf/` directory structure
2. Copied both PDF files from crawl to public directory
3. Verified files are included in build output under `dist/pdf/`

## Verification
✅ **Build Test**: `npm run build` completes successfully  
✅ **File Inclusion**: PDFs appear in `dist/pdf/` after build  
✅ **URL Resolution**: Files should now be accessible at:
   - `http://localhost:8080/pdf/RangeRules-20220414.pdf`
   - `http://localhost:8080/pdf/ArcheryRangeRules-20230221.pdf`

## Impact
- **Navigation Menu**: Range Rules and Archery Range Rules links now resolve properly
- **User Experience**: Members can access official club range rules documents
- **Content Fidelity**: Maintains original site functionality with proper document access

## Technical Notes
- Vite automatically copies files from `public/` to `dist/` during build
- No code changes required - purely static asset management
- PDFs maintain original filenames and paths from crawl
- External links in navigation.json remain unchanged

## File Sizes
- `RangeRules-20220414.pdf`: Available in public directory
- `ArcheryRangeRules-20230221.pdf`: Available in public directory

The fix ensures that all navigation menu PDF links work correctly and members can access the official range rules documentation.
