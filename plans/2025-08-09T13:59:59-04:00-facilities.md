# Facilities Page Clone Plan
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-09T13:59:59-04:00
**Target Page:** facilities.html from waylandgc.org

## Analysis Summary

The facilities.html page is a simple content page that describes the club's physical facilities and features. The page contains:
- **Page Title**: "Facilities" (H1)
- **Club House Section**: Description with link to clubhouse.html
- **Indoor Range Section**: Detailed information about indoor shooting range with restrictions and PDF link
- **Outdoor Range Section**: Information about outdoor shooting range specifications

The page structure is straightforward with hierarchical headings and informational content, making it ideal for a content-focused page component.

## Architecture Overview

Convert the facilities page into a modern React component that leverages:
1. **Existing Layout System** (MainLayout component)
2. **Content Sections** for each facility type
3. **Reusable UI Components** for links and navigation
4. **Type-safe Data Management** for facility information

## Required Components

### 1. Reuse Existing Layout Components

#### `src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx` (REUSE)
- Use existing responsive layout with sidebar navigation
- Maintains consistent site structure and navigation

### 2. New Section Components

#### `src/components/sections/FacilitiesHeader.tsx` (NEW)
- Page title and introductory content
- **Content Source:** crawl/waylandgc.org/facilities.html line 8 (H1 title)

#### `src/components/sections/FacilitySection.tsx` (NEW)  
- Reusable component for individual facility descriptions
- Props: title, description, links, restrictions
- Used for Club House, Indoor Range, and Outdoor Range sections
- **Content Sources:**
  - Club House: lines 9-11 (heading, description, clubhouse.html link)
  - Indoor Range: lines 12-18 (heading, description, caliber restrictions, PDF link)  
  - Outdoor Range: lines 19-23 (heading, description, specifications)

### 3. Reuse Existing UI Components

#### `src/components/ui/ExternalLink.tsx` (REUSE)
- For PDF document links and external references
- Ensures proper security attributes and target handling

## Required Data Files

### `src/data/facilities.json` (NEW)
**TypeScript Interface:** Add to `src/data/types.ts`
```typescript
export interface FacilityInfo {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  links?: Array<{
    label: string;
    href: string;
    external?: boolean;
    target?: string;
  }>;
  specifications?: string[];
  restrictions?: string[];
}

export interface FacilitiesData {
  pageTitle: string;
  facilities: FacilityInfo[];
}
```
**Content Sources:**
- Club House: crawl/waylandgc.org/facilities.html lines 9-11
- Indoor Range: lines 12-18 (including caliber restrictions and PDF link)
- Outdoor Range: lines 19-23

## Required Custom Hooks

### `src/hooks/useFacilitiesData.ts` (NEW)
- Type-safe access to facilities page content
- Returns facilities array and page metadata
- Follows established pattern from existing hooks

## Page Component

### `src/pages/Facilities.tsx` (NEW)
- Main facilities page component
- Uses MainLayout for consistent structure
- Composes FacilitiesHeader and multiple FacilitySection components
- Maps over facilities data to render each section

## Styling Requirements

### Design Consistency
- **Typography**: Use consistent heading hierarchy (H1 for page title, H2 for facility names)
- **Spacing**: Maintain uniform spacing between sections
- **Links**: Style internal and external links consistently with existing patterns
- **Layout**: Single-column content layout within the main content area

### Content Structure
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Clear visual separation between different facilities
- **Link Styling**: Distinguish between internal navigation links and external document links
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure readability across all device sizes

## Media Assets Integration

### Required Documents
- **PDF Link**: Indoor_Range_Firearm_Caliber_Restrictions.pdf referenced in indoor range section
- **Internal Links**: clubhouse.html, indoor.html, outdoor.html (handled as internal navigation)

### Asset Handling
- External PDF links should use ExternalLink component with target="_blank"
- Internal page links should be handled through React Router (future enhancement)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create Data Layer**: facilities.json with structured facility information and TypeScript interface
2. **Develop Custom Hook**: useFacilitiesData for type-safe data access
3. **Build Section Components**: FacilitiesHeader and reusable FacilitySection
4. **Create Page Component**: Facilities page using MainLayout and section components
5. **Content Migration**: Extract and structure all text content from crawl/waylandgc.org/facilities.html
6. **Routing Integration**: Add facilities route to main App.tsx router configuration
7. **Link Validation**: Ensure all internal and external links function correctly

## Content Fidelity Notes

- **Complete Text Preservation**: Maintain exact wording from original HTML
- **Link Accuracy**: Preserve all hrefs and target attributes from original links
- **Content Structure**: Maintain hierarchical organization with proper heading levels
- **Document References**: Keep PDF link to Indoor_Range_Firearm_Caliber_Restrictions.pdf
- **Internal Navigation**: Preserve references to clubhouse.html, indoor.html, outdoor.html for future page creation

## URL Structure

- **Route Path**: `/facilities`
- **Page Component**: `Facilities.tsx`
- **Navigation Integration**: Update existing sidebar navigation to link to facilities route

## Reusability Benefits

- **FacilitySection Component**: Can be reused for future facility-related pages
- **Data Pattern**: Establishes pattern for other informational pages
- **Layout Consistency**: Maintains visual consistency with existing index page
- **Hook Pattern**: Follows established data access patterns

This plan creates a structured, maintainable facilities page that integrates seamlessly with the existing React architecture while preserving all original content and functionality.
