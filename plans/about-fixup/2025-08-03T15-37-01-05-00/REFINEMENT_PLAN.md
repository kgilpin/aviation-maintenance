**Created**: 2025-08-03T15:37:01-05:00  
**Target**: Match live site at https://yankeeaviation.com/about  
**Local**: http://localhost:5173/about

## Screenshot Comparison Analysis

### Major Differences Identified

#### 1. **Hero Section Structure** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Live Site**: Simple blue gradient background with centered "ABOUT" heading
- **Local Site**: Complex hero section with full company description and background image
- **Issue**: Local implementation uses a different hero design entirely

#### 2. **Content Layout Structure** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Live Site**: Clean, minimal layout with individual team member sections
- **Local Site**: Complex multi-section layout with company history, timeline, and team grid
- **Issue**: Completely different page structure and content organization

#### 3. **Team Member Presentation** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Live Site**: Individual sections per team member with left/right alternating layout
- **Local Site**: Grid-based team member cards with modal functionality
- **Issue**: Different layout approach - should use alternating text/image sections

#### 4. **Content Sections Missing/Different** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Live Site**: Has individual biographical sections for each team member
- **Local Site**: Has company history section, timeline, and card-based team display
- **Issue**: Missing the specific biographical layout from live site

#### 5. **Team Member Content** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Live Site**: Shows specific team members (Peter Conner not prominently featured in visible area)
- **Local Site**: Shows all 5 team members including Peter Conner
- **Issue**: Need to verify which team members should be prominently displayed

#### 6. **Typography and Spacing** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Live Site**: More compact, cleaner typography
- **Local Site**: Larger headers and more spacing
- **Issue**: Typography scale and spacing doesn't match

#### 7. **Background Colors** (LOW PRIORITY)
- **Live Site**: White/light gray backgrounds for team sections
- **Local Site**: Various background colors (gray, white) with more contrast
- **Issue**: Background color scheme should be more consistent

## Implementation Strategy

The local implementation is significantly different from the live site. Instead of minor tweaks, this requires a substantial restructure to match the live site's simpler, more focused layout.

### Priority Classification:
- **HIGH**: Structural changes that affect core layout and functionality
- **MEDIUM**: Content and styling adjustments
- **LOW**: Fine-tuning and polish items

## Next Steps

1. Restructure the about page to match the live site's simple layout
2. Replace complex hero section with simple centered title
3. Replace team grid with alternating individual biographical sections
4. Remove company history section (not present on live site)
5. Adjust typography and spacing to match live site
6. Test responsive behavior to ensure mobile compatibility
