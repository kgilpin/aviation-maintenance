**Created:** 2025-08-03T09:29:30,616606000-05:00

## Analysis

After comparing the localhost implementation with the live site at https://www.falconairinc.com/, significant differences were identified:

### Current Local Implementation Issues:
- Basic text-only layout with no styling
- Missing hero section with background image
- No navigation bar
- Plain bullet-point lists instead of styled sections
- Missing photo gallery

- No proper color scheme (should be blue/white)
- Contains placeholder content not on live site

### Live Site Key Features:
- Hero section with blurred aircraft background and "Amenities" overlay text
- Professional navigation bar with logo
- Styled amenities list with "Learn More" button
- Photo gallery with 5 aircraft/facility images
- Partner logos section (FAA, NBAA, American Bonanza Society)
