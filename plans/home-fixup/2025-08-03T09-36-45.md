# Home Page Refinement - Second Iteration
**Created:** 2025-08-03T09:36:45,657296000-05:00

## Comparison Analysis

After comparing the current local implementation with the fresh live site screenshot, the implementation is very close but has some minor refinements needed:

### Current State - Very Good Match:
✅ Blue gradient background matches perfectly  
✅ Amenities section content and styling correct  
✅ Photo gallery layout and images correct  
✅ Partner logos section present and functional  
✅ Footer with Facebook icon matches  
✅ Overall color scheme and structure excellent  

### Areas for Fine-Tuning:

## Second Iteration TODO Items

### High Priority
1. **Add proper hero section with blurred aircraft background image visible**
   - The live site shows a subtle blurred aircraft image behind the "Amenities" text
   - Currently the hero section background is not visible due to overlay
   - Need to adjust overlay opacity or ensure background image loads

### Medium Priority  
2. **Center the amenities list text properly**
   - Amenities items should be more centered and aligned
   - Text spacing could be optimized to match live site exactly

3. **Adjust hero section height to match live site proportions**
   - Hero section appears slightly different in height proportion
   - Should match the live site's hero-to-content ratio

### Low Priority
4. **Fine-tune navigation bar styling to match live site exactly**
   - Navigation looks good but could be refined for exact match
   - Logo positioning and menu spacing optimization

5. **Optimize partner logo spacing and sizing**
   - Partner logos are present but spacing could be fine-tuned
   - Ensure exact sizing matches live site

## Implementation Strategy

1. Focus on hero background visibility first (high priority)
2. Adjust amenities text centering for better visual match
3. Fine-tune proportions and spacing for exact match
4. Polish navigation and logo details

## Success Criteria for This Iteration

- Hero section shows subtle blurred background image
- Amenities text perfectly centered and spaced
- Overall proportions match live site exactly
- Only minor cosmetic differences remain
