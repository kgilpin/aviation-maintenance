## Implementation Notes

### Dependencies
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- Header/Footer should be completed before content sections
- Data files should be created first to support all components
- Styling can be done incrementally alongside component development

### Testing Strategy
- Test each component individually before integration
- Use browser dev tools for responsive testing
- Validate HTML and CSS at each phase
- Test form functionality early to identify processing issues

### Quality Checkpoints
- After Phase 2: Basic site structure is functional
- After Phase 3: All homepage content is present and functional
- After Phase 4: Site is visually polished and performant
- After Phase 5: Site is ready for production deployment

### Time Estimates
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 hours (data setup and templates)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 hours (header/footer components)
- **Phase 3**: 6-8 hours (main content sections)
- **Phase 4**: 4-5 hours (styling and optimization)
- **Phase 5**: 2-3 hours (testing and refinement)
- **Phase 6**: 1-2 hours (deployment preparation)

**Total Estimated Time**: 18-25 hours
