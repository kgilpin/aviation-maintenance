- **Supporting components**: HeroSection, AmenitiesSection, GallerySection, PartnersSection
- **Layout components**: Header, Footer, Navigation

2. **Verify navigation links** match crawled structure
3. **Update company branding** and messaging

2. **AmenitiesSection**: Verify amenities list matches crawled content
3. **GallerySection**: Update images to match crawled gallery
4. **PartnersSection**: Add/update partner logos as needed

### Phase 3: Data Consistency
1. **Company data**: Update company.json with correct details
2. **Contact data**: Ensure phone number and location match
3. **Navigation data**: Align menu structure with crawled site
