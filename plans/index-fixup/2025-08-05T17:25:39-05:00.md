## Screenshot Comparison Analysis

### Major Differences Identified

1. **Hero Section Content Structure**

   - **Issue**: Section ordering doesn't match live site layout

4. **Testimonial Slider Missing**

   - **Local Site**: No testimonial section implemented

5. **App Promotion Section Differences**
   - **Live Site**: Shows course photo on left, app promotion text on right with different banner image
   - **Local Site**: Shows centered banner image with minimal text
   - **Issue**: Layout and content don't match

6. **Hours and Contact Information Missing**
   - **Live Site**: Shows "Our Hours" section with contact details in footer area
   - **Local Site**: Missing operating hours information
   - **Impact**: Important business information is absent

7. **Course Photos and Gallery Missing**
   - **Live Site**: Prominently features golf course photography throughout
   - **Local Site**: Limited use of course imagery
   - **Issue**: Visual appeal and course showcase is reduced
