## Comparison Analysis

After the previous refinements, the local site now closely matches the live site with most major elements correctly implemented. However, there are still a few minor differences to address:

### Remaining Differences Identified

1. **Hero Section Video Background**
   - **Live Site**: Shows actual video background playing behind text
   - **Local Site**: Shows gray placeholder background instead of video
   - **Issue**: Video background may not be loading/playing correctly

2. **Section Background Colors**
   - **Live Site**: Some sections have slightly different background colors/tones
   - **Local Site**: Using standard gray backgrounds
   - **Issue**: Minor color matching differences

3. **Contact Section Hours Layout**
   - **Live Site**: May have different spacing/formatting for hours information
   - **Local Site**: Hours display added but may need formatting adjustment
   - **Issue**: Minor layout differences in contact section

## Final Refinement TODO List

### HIGH PRIORITY

1. **Fix Hero Video Background** ⭐⭐⭐
   - Investigate why video background is not displaying
   - Check video file path and accessibility
   - Ensure video component is properly loading the background video
   - Test video autoplay and loop functionality

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

2. **Check and Fix Video File Path** ⭐⭐
   - Verify the video file exists at the correct path
   - Update video file path if necessary
   - Test video loading in browser developer tools

3. **Network Monitoring for Video Assets** ⭐⭐
   - Use network monitor to check if video file is loading correctly
   - Check for 404 errors or loading issues with video assets
   - Verify video file format compatibility

### LOW PRIORITY

4. **Fine-tune Background Colors** ⭐
   - Adjust section background colors to more closely match live site
   - Review color palette and make minor adjustments
   - Ensure consistent styling across all sections

5. **Contact Section Formatting** ⭐
   - Review hours display formatting in contact section
   - Make minor spacing/layout adjustments if needed
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness of hours display

## Investigation Plan

1. **Video Asset Check**: First, verify that the video file exists and is accessible
2. **Network Analysis**: Use browser tools to check video loading
3. **Component Debug**: Review VideoPlayer component implementation
4. **Path Verification**: Ensure video paths are correct in data files

## Success Criteria

- Hero section displays actual video background instead of gray placeholder
- Video autoplays and loops correctly
- All sections maintain proper background colors
- Contact section displays hours information with proper formatting
- Site maintains responsive design across all device sizes

## Notes

The site has achieved excellent visual parity with the live site in terms of:
- ✅ Layout and section ordering
- ✅ Text content and messaging
- ✅ CTA buttons and navigation
- ✅ Testimonial slider functionality
- ✅ Business information display
- ✅ Responsive design

The primary remaining issue appears to be the video background loading/display in the hero section.
