# Menu Location Page Refinement Plan

**Timestamp:** 2025-08-09T14:48:35-04:00

## Comparison Analysis

After comparing the local implementation with the live site, several key differences were identified:

### Live Site Structure (from screenshots):
- Logo centered at top
- Club information (Wayland Rod & Gun Club, address, phone) centered below logo
- Navigation menu starts on the left side with no sidebar
- Simple vertical list of navigation links
- "Location" has sub-items indented with quotes
- "Previous Events!" appears at the bottom with significant spacing above it
- Clean, minimal layout focused entirely on navigation

### Local Implementation Issues:
- Uses MainLayout with left sidebar navigation
- Navigation appears in main content area alongside sidebar
- Different visual hierarchy and spacing
- Layout doesn't match the original's frameset-like structure

## TODO List

### High Priority Items:

1. **Remove MainLayout wrapper** - The menu location page should be a standalone navigation page without the standard site layout
   - Priority: **HIGH**
   - The live site shows this is meant to be a navigation menu, likely used in a frameset

2. **Implement proper layout structure** - Match the original table-based layout
   - Priority: **HIGH** 
   - Center logo and club info at top
   - Left-align navigation menu with proper indentation for sub-items

3. **Fix sub-item indentation** - The "Club House" and "Outdoor Range" items should be indented with quote marks
   - Priority: **HIGH**
   - Use &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp; prefix as in original HTML

4. **Add proper vertical spacing** - Significant spacing before "Previous Events!" link
   - Priority: **MEDIUM**
   - Multiple <br> tags create large gap in original

### Medium Priority Items:

5. **Match original typography** - Use Arial font family and proper font sizes
   - Priority: **MEDIUM**
   - Original uses font size="-1" and size="2" attributes

6. **Fix background color implementation** - Ensure lightseagreen background covers full page
   - Priority: **MEDIUM**
   - Should be applied to body, not just MainLayout

### Low Priority Items:

7. **Review link styling** - Ensure links match original blue color and underline behavior
   - Priority: **LOW**
   - Basic browser defaults should suffice

## Implementation Strategy

The menu location page appears to be designed as a navigation frame in the original frameset architecture. The local implementation should be completely restructured to match this simpler, standalone navigation design rather than trying to fit it into the MainLayout pattern used by other pages.
