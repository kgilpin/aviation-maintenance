# Tailwind CSS Migration Overview

## Purpose
Migrate all styles from `style.css` to Tailwind CSS while maintaining full functionality and visual consistency across the Eagle East Aviation website.

## Current State
- **style.css**: 503 lines of custom CSS
- **Current approach**: Importing style.css into Tailwind input.css (temporary solution)
- **Goal**: Replace all custom CSS with Tailwind utility classes and component classes

## Migration Benefits
- **Consistency**: Standardized spacing, colors, and typography
- **Maintainability**: Utility-first approach reduces CSS bloat
- **Performance**: Purged CSS contains only used classes
- **Developer Experience**: IntelliSense and consistent naming conventions
- **Responsiveness**: Built-in responsive design system

## Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Base styles and typography
2. **Phase 2**: Component styles (buttons, forms, navigation)
3. **Phase 3**: Layout sections (hero, services, footer)
4. **Phase 4**: Interactive states and animations
5. **Phase 5**: Responsive design migration
6. **Phase 6**: Cleanup and optimization

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All visual elements match current design exactly
- ✅ All interactive functionality preserved
- ✅ Responsive design works across all breakpoints
- ✅ Performance maintained or improved
- ✅ Code is more maintainable and consistent

## Risk Mitigation
- Migrate incrementally with testing at each phase
- Keep original styles as backup during migration
- Use component classes for complex reusable patterns
- Maintain git history for easy rollback if needed
